      <h1>Baalbek Megaliths</h1>
      <p class="summary">At the Roman temple complex of Baalbek in Lebanon, several monumental stones lie in and near the Temple of Jupiter.  The three Trilithon blocks forming part of the podium weigh roughly 750–800 tonnes each, while the so‑called “Stone of the Pregnant Woman”, “Stone of the South” and “Forgotten Stone” in the nearby quarry weigh about 1,000 t, 1,242 t and 1,650 t respectively【695684898447223†L146-L154】.  How these stones were cut, moved and lifted in the 1st century AD remains debated.</p>

        <h2>Why It’s Intriguing</h2>
        <p>The Baalbek podium features some of the largest stones ever quarried by humans.  Moving objects weighing over 800 tonnes would challenge even modern cranes, prompting questions about Roman engineering capabilities.  The quarry stones, weighing up to 1,650 tonnes, remain partly detached, suggesting that the builders either abandoned them or never attempted transportation.  How labourers lifted the Trilithon stones several metres into position without evidence of large ramps is still debated among engineers and archaeologists.</p>

      <section class="orthodox">
        <h2>Orthodox Explanation</h2>
        <p>Archaeologists propose that Roman engineers used a combination of earthen ramps, rollers and winches to move and raise the stones.  Since the quarry sits higher than the temple, the blocks may have been dragged downhill on sledges.  Once at the site, complex lifting frames and levers might have allowed them to be positioned.  The unfinished stones in the quarry could indicate that the scale of the undertaking proved impractical, leading the builders to use smaller blocks for the remainder of the project.</p>

      <section class="pro-theory">
        <h2>Pro‑Theory Reading <em>(Hypothesis)</em></h2>
        <p>Ancient astronaut proponents see Baalbek’s gargantuan stones as beyond the realistic capability of Roman or earlier societies.  They argue that modern heavy‑lift cranes struggle to move such masses, implying that advanced technology or external assistance was involved.  The presence of multiple unfinished stones in the quarry suggests that ancient engineers may have attempted tasks beyond their means, possibly inspired or aided by visitors with superior knowledge.</p>
