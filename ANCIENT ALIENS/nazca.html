      <h1>Nazca Lines</h1>
      <p class="summary">The Nazca Lines are geoglyphs etched into the desert plains of southern Peru between 500&nbsp;BC and 500&nbsp;AD【459144329618512†L220-L245】.  Comprising over 800 straight lines, spirals, trapezoids and animal figures, the designs stretch for a combined length exceeding 1,300&nbsp;km and cover about 50 km²【459144329618512†L230-L237】.  The furrows are typically 10–15 cm deep and about 33 cm wide, though some are up to 1.8 m wide【459144329618512†L230-L237】.  Many figures are hundreds of metres long and are best seen from the air at heights around 500 m【459144329618512†L239-L243】.</p>

        <h2>Why It’s Intriguing</h2>
        <p>The sheer scale of the Nazca Lines and their visibility from the air have long fascinated researchers.  Some shapes depict animals such as monkeys and hummingbirds, while others are abstract geometric forms.  The purpose of the lines is uncertain—proposed functions include astronomical calendar, irrigation symbols, pilgrimage pathways or ceremonial art.  That many designs are only fully appreciable from above fuels speculation about aerial observations in antiquity.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="orthodox">
        <h2>Orthodox Explanation</h2>
        <p>Most archaeologists interpret the Nazca Lines as ritual landscape works created by the Nazca culture.  Lines were made by scraping the desert surface to reveal the lighter clay beneath.  Scholars suggest they relate to water sources, cosmology or social organisation.  The ability to see the designs from nearby foothills may have been sufficient for planning, and a gridded plotting method could have been used without flight.</p>

      <section class="pro-theory">
        <h2>Pro‑Theory Reading <em>(Hypothesis)</em></h2>
        <p>Some propose that the lines served as landing strips or messages for aerial visitors.  The animal geoglyphs are interpreted as signals to beings in the sky, while the straight lines and trapezoids are viewed as runways.  Others suggest that ancient people could only conceive such designs with assistance from individuals who had seen the Earth from above.  Evidence for these claims remains speculative and is contested by mainstream archaeologists.</p>
