      <h1>Quimbaya “Airplanes”</h1>
      <p class="summary">A small group of gold figurines from the Quimbaya culture of pre‑Columbian Colombia have been popularised as “ancient airplanes”.  These stylised animal and insect figures measure roughly 5–7.5 cm in length【586872922408737†L185-L187】 and were created between 500 BC and 600 AD.  While some shapes vaguely resemble delta‑wing aircraft, archaeologists identify them as depictions of local fish or birds【586872922408737†L365-L370】.</p>

        <h2>Why It’s Intriguing</h2>
        <p>The smooth lines and swept wings of some Quimbaya figurines evoke modern aircraft, inspiring enthusiasts to build scale gliders based on their shape.  The ability of such gliders to fly has been touted as evidence of ancient knowledge of aerodynamics.  These claims overlook the rich tradition of animal symbolism in Quimbaya art and the small scale of the objects.</p>

      <section class="orthodox">
        <h2>Orthodox Explanation</h2>
        <p>Museum curators and archaeologists categorise the objects as zoomorphic pendants representing birds, fish or bats.  Their triangular forms may reflect local species like flying fish or birds of prey.  The small size (around 5 cm) indicates they were personal ornaments, not models for full‑scale aircraft.  Experimental glider constructions use modern materials and adjust proportions to achieve flight, which is not evidence of ancient aviation.</p>

      <section class="pro-theory">
        <h2>Pro‑Theory Reading <em>(Hypothesis)</em></h2>
        <p>Ancient astronaut proponents assert that the Quimbaya figurines are scale models of flying machines, citing their aerodynamic shapes and tail fins.  They note that two German engineers built a glider based on one figure that could fly.  Critics argue that these reconstructions alter the original design and rely on modern understanding of aerodynamics, while the Quimbaya pieces remain purely artistic.</p>

        <h2>Contextual Notes</h2>
        <p>As small ornaments, the Quimbaya figures do not provide numerical metrics beyond their dimensions.  Comparisons to actual aircraft rely on speculative scaling.</p>
