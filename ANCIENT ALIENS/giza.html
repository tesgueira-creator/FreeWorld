      <h1>Great Pyramid of Giza</h1>
      <p class="summary">The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest of Egypt’s Old Kingdom pyramids.  Built from around 2.3&nbsp;million limestone blocks with an estimated total mass of six million tonnes, its construction around 2560 BC remains a marvel of ancient engineering【71506191741196†L374-L381】.  Precise alignment to the cardinal directions and the enormous weight of its granite chambers fuel debate about whether human ingenuity alone explains its creation.</p>

        <h2>Why It’s Intriguing</h2>
        <p>The sheer scale and precision of the Great Pyramid raise questions about the technological capabilities of the Fourth Dynasty Egyptians.  Constructed from millions of heavy blocks, some weighing up to 80 tonnes and transported from hundreds of kilometres away, the monument’s joints are remarkably tight and its base is aligned almost perfectly to the cardinal directions【71506191741196†L374-L381】【71506191741196†L983-L1004】.  How the builders organised labour, logistics and measurements remains debated.</p>

      <section class="orthodox">
        <h2>Orthodox Explanation</h2>
        <p>Mainstream Egyptology holds that the pyramid was built as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu using simple tools, sledges and ramps.  Archaeologists suggest a workforce of tens of thousands of skilled labourers and seasonal workers, using copper tools to quarry limestone and ropes to move blocks on lubricated sledges.  Experimental archaeology has shown that heavy stones can be transported with large teams and ingenuity.  The alignment may have been achieved using stellar observations.</p>

      <section class="pro-theory">
        <h2>Pro‑Theory Reading <em>(Hypothesis)</em></h2>
        <p>Proponents of the Ancient Astronaut theory argue that the pyramid’s size, precision and astronomical alignment suggest involvement or knowledge imparted by advanced visitors.  They point to the massive granite beams in the King’s Chamber, weighing up to 80 tonnes【71506191741196†L374-L381】, and the minimal deviation from true north【71506191741196†L983-L1004】 as evidence that construction methods exceeded Bronze‑Age capabilities.  Some hypothesise that energy or resonance properties were important, framing the structure as more than a tomb.</p>
