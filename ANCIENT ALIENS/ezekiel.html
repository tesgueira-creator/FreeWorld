      <h1>Ezekiel’s Vision (Ophanim)</h1>
      <p class="summary">In the biblical Book of Ezekiel, the prophet describes a vision of a divine chariot borne by winged creatures with “wheels within wheels” full of eyes【73760140729290†L142-L156】.  The Hebrew term <em>ophanim</em> (“wheels”) refers to these wheel‑like entities.  Some modern writers have interpreted this vision as a description of a spacecraft.  Traditional Judeo‑Christian theology, however, classifies the ophanim as angelic beings within the heavenly hierarchy.</p>

        <h2>Why It’s Intriguing</h2>
        <p>The vivid imagery of spinning wheels, eyes and creatures in Ezekiel’s vision invites imaginative interpretation.  Ancient astronaut theorists see parallels between the nested wheels and mechanical devices, while others view the eyes as lights or portholes.  The description has inspired numerous artworks and analyses over the centuries.</p>

      <section class="orthodox">
        <h2>Orthodox Explanation</h2>
        <p>Religious scholars interpret Ezekiel’s vision within the context of apocalyptic literature.  The ophanim are part of the prophetic symbolism of the divine chariot (Merkabah) and represent the unknowable nature of God.  Jewish mystical tradition places the ophanim among the higher orders of angels.  The imagery is not intended as a technological description but as a theological metaphor.</p>

        <h2>Pro‑Theory Reading <em>(Hypothesis)</em></h2>
        <p>Ancient astronaut authors, such as Josef Blumrich in <em>The Spaceships of Ezekiel</em>, argue that the vision describes a spacecraft and that Ezekiel witnessed a landing.  They interpret the wheels and cherubim as mechanical landing gear and rockets.  Critics note that Blumrich’s book is considered pseudoscientific and that the interpretation ignores the symbolic and theological context【593966421481785†L146-L154】.</p>
