      <h1>Antikythera Mechanism</h1>
      <p class="summary">Recovered from a 1st‑century BC shipwreck near the Greek island of Antikythera, the Antikythera mechanism is an intricate geared device that modelled the movements of the Sun, Moon and planets.  High‑resolution scans reveal it contained at least 37 interlocking bronze gears【654768733189757†L250-L260】, enabling it to predict eclipses and track celestial cycles.  Dated to around 150–100 BC【654768733189757†L264-L271】, it is often hailed as the world’s first known analogue computer; machines of similar complexity did not appear again until medieval astronomical clocks【654768733189757†L334-L339】.</p>

        <h2>Why It’s Intriguing</h2>
        <p>The mechanism’s sophistication demonstrates that ancient Hellenistic scientists possessed advanced knowledge of gearing and astronomy.  The device’s ability to calculate eclipses and synodic cycles challenges modern assumptions about the technological capabilities of classical antiquity.  Its apparent uniqueness—no similar mechanisms survive—raises questions about whether it represents a lost tradition or an isolated masterpiece.</p>

      <section class="orthodox">
        <h2>Orthodox Explanation</h2>
        <p>Historians of technology see the Antikythera mechanism as a product of Greek mechanical ingenuity, possibly associated with the school of Archimedes or Hipparchus.  The Greeks developed sophisticated gearwork for devices such as astrolabes and odometers.  This mechanism likely served educational or calendrical purposes for elite patrons.  Its survival in a shipwreck is fortuitous; similar devices may have existed but decayed.</p>

      <section class="pro-theory">
        <h2>Pro‑Theory Reading <em>(Hypothesis)</em></h2>
        <p>Some propose that the precision and complexity of the Antikythera mechanism exceed the known metallurgical and mathematical capabilities of its era, implying either a forgotten high‑technology civilisation or external influence.  Ancient astronaut enthusiasts see the device as evidence of knowledge transfer from visitors, noting that comparable geared mechanisms did not reappear until 1,500 years later.  However, mainstream scholars attribute its sophistication to the cumulative advances of Hellenistic science.</p>

        <h2>Contextual Notes</h2>
        <p>No mass or distance metrics apply, but the mechanism’s functional complexity can be compared qualitatively with later clocks and calculators.</p>
