    <h1>Modern Ufology</h1>
    <p>Modern reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and unexplained aerial phenomena span from the late 1940s to today.  This section summarises notable cases and explores correlations between ancient sites and modern sighting clusters.</p>

      <h2>Timeline of Key Events</h2>
      <ul class="timeline-list">
        <li><strong>1947 – Roswell Incident:</strong> Alleged crash of an unknown object near Roswell, New Mexico; military recovery fuels decades of speculation.</li>
        <li><strong>1952 – Washington D.C. UFO flap:</strong> Radar anomalies and multiple sightings over the U.S. capital lead to Air Force investigation.</li>
        <li><strong>1961 – Hill Abduction:</strong> Betty and Barney Hill report being taken aboard a craft; first widely publicised abduction story.</li>
        <li><strong>1973 – Pascagoula encounter:</strong> Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claim to have been abducted by humanoid beings in Mississippi.</li>
        <li><strong>2004–2015 – U.S. Navy encounters:</strong> Infrared footage (e.g. “Gimbal”, “GoFast”) recorded by fighter jets shows unidentified aerial objects performing unusual manoeuvres.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Correlation Map</h2>
      <p>Our interactive atlas (under construction) will allow you to overlay modern sighting clusters on the map of ancient sites.  Preliminary observations suggest some overlap between regions with high densities of ancient structures and frequent modern reports.  Further data collection and analysis are required to determine whether this correlation is significant.</p>
