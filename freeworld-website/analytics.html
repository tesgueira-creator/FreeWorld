        <h3 class="chart-title">Sighting Volume</h3>
        <canvas id="chart1" class="chart-canvas" width="560" height="320" aria-label="Line chart of monthly counts by shape"></canvas>
        <p class="chart-interpretation">This chart plots the number of sightings per shape each month. Spikes point to bursts of activity, but caution: z‑scores assume stationarity and cannot distinguish between genuine flurries and reporting artefacts.</p>
        <p class="chart-limitations">Limitations: dataset may be biased toward certain regions; smoothing techniques are not applied here.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chart-card">
        <h3 class="chart-title">Shape Evolution</h3>
        <canvas id="chart2" class="chart-canvas" width="560" height="320" aria-label="Line chart of shape evolution"></canvas>
        <p class="chart-interpretation">Observe how the prevalence of discs, spheres and other shapes changes over time. Plateaus could indicate persistent phenomena; declines might reflect fading interest or classification changes.</p>
        <p class="chart-limitations">Limitations: shapes are normalised at load time; rare categories may be underrepresented.</p>

      <div class="chart-card">
        <h3 class="chart-title">Confidence Trend</h3>
        <canvas id="chart3" class="chart-canvas" width="560" height="320" aria-label="Line chart of confidence scores"></canvas>
        <p class="chart-interpretation">Tracking mean confidence scores across months reveals how sure witnesses feel about what they saw. Upswings may correspond to clear conditions or improvements in observation equipment.</p>
        <p class="chart-limitations">Limitations: confidence is subjective and self‑reported; extreme values may distort the mean.</p>

      <div class="chart-card">
        <h3 class="chart-title">City Persistence</h3>
        <canvas id="chart4" class="chart-canvas" width="560" height="320" aria-label="Line chart of city persistence"></canvas>
        <p class="chart-interpretation">Cities with consistent monthly reports stand out as persistent clusters. Such persistence might indicate long‑term surveillance or simply well‑connected local communities reporting more often.</p>
        <p class="chart-limitations">Limitations: this view does not control for population size or reporting platforms.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chart-card">
        <h3 class="chart-title">Shape Diversity</h3>
        <canvas id="chart5" class="chart-canvas" width="560" height="320" aria-label="Line chart of shape diversity"></canvas>
        <p class="chart-interpretation">Diversity metrics measure how evenly different shapes are represented. High values reflect a rich mixture of forms, while low values suggest domination by a few types.</p>
        <p class="chart-limitations">Limitations: diversity indices do not capture underlying causes; outliers may skew perception.</p>

        <canvas id="chart6" class="chart-canvas" width="560" height="320" aria-label="Line chart of new city emergence"></canvas>
        <p class="chart-interpretation">The appearance of new reporting locations over time can highlight expanding awareness or novel flight paths. A surge may coincide with media campaigns or scientific outreach.</p>
        <p class="chart-limitations">Limitations: our data only captures first occurrences; follow‑up reports are not shown here.</p>
