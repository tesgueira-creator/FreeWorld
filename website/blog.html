      <h3>Are We Alone in the Universe?</h3>
      <p>
        Since the dawn of civilisation, humans have gazed up at the night sky and wondered whether we share the cosmos with other life forms. NASA reminds us that, so far, Earth remains the only confirmed home for life. Nevertheless, scientists are on a quest to find <em>telltale signs of life</em> beyond our planet. By analysing the mix of gases in exoplanet atmospheres – oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane and others – telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope may detect chemical fingerprints associated with life and even photosynthesis<span class="citation-ref"><a href="#cite-1">[1]</a></span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Universe's eerie silence has a name: the <strong>Fermi paradox</strong>. In 1950, physicist Enrico Fermi famously asked: “Where is everybody?” Even at modest travel speeds, the billions of years of cosmic history would allow time for intelligent, technological civilisations to spread across the galaxy, yet we hear nothing. According to NASA, exoplanet discoveries have started to fill in the terms of the Drake Equation – a formula estimating the number of detectable civilisations – but many variables remain unknown. We stand at a crossroads: thousands of planets have been discovered in their stars' habitable zones, our instruments grow ever more powerful, yet Earth is still the only world known to host life<span class="citation-ref"><a href="#cite-2">[2]</a></span>.
      </p>
      <h4>Listening for Visitors</h4>
      <p>
        Radio telescopes operated by the SETI Institute sweep the heavens for faint signals that might betray an intelligent origin. While no definitive message has been detected, each survey refines our understanding of the cosmos and pushes the boundaries of technology and imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website doesn't claim proof of extraterrestrial visitors. Instead, it offers a window into the human fascination with the unknown. Explore more than 1,400 UFO sighting reports, discover patterns in shapes and locations, and reflect on why the cosmos remains so quiet. Whether you're a skeptic or a believer, we invite you to dive into the data and draw your own conclusions.

      <h3>Decoding Mysterious Crop Circles</h3>
      <h4>The Debate Between Hoax and Phenomenon</h4>
      <p>
        For decades, intricate patterns have appeared overnight in fields around the world. While many crop circles are confirmed hoaxes, some display mathematical precision that intrigues researchers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scientists analyse soil samples, magnetic anomalies and eyewitness accounts to determine whether natural phenomena or human pranksters are responsible. Regardless of origin, crop circles capture the imagination and keep the question of extraterrestrial visitors alive.
      </p>
      <h4>Cultural Impact</h4>
      <p>
        Beyond scientific curiosity, crop circles influence local tourism and inspire countless works of fiction. Their appearance each summer sparks community debates and draws enthusiasts equipped with drones, cameras and measuring tape.
